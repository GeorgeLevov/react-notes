# Markdown Notes

This app's title fully describes the entire project.

Initially picked up as a course refactoring project, I decided to create it from scratch, completed it and have now deployed it to use as a personal writing tool that will help me with formatting documentation.
And it's already been in use, helping me write all my React projects' READMEs for Github.

Since my first JavaScript project was a to-do notes list utilizing local-storage,
this project helped me to think in React, and better compare it to vanilla JS.

## Dependencies :

The project integrates a few npm packages outside of React/ReactDOM
